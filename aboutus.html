  all about sports, at the professional, Olympic, collegiate, interscholastic, and recreational levels.
  
  The Shaurya Cricket Sports Academy was the first and is the only of its kind in the India. It was established in
  1972 to turn around a new scientific finding that linked poor preparation of coaches to the injuries incurred by the
  students they supervised. Today, coaches everywhere can prepare thoroughly for their work. Through sports-focused
  instruction, support of research, and teamwork with professional groups like the National Federation of State High
  School Associations, the Academy showed how to meet sports professionals’ educational needs.
  
  The Academy’s first decades have also coincided with the general awakening to the role of exercise in health and the
  value of individual commitment to healthy living. This has meant expanding employment opportunities for our graduates.
  
  The Shaurya Cricket Academy is India’s Sports University, with graduates worldwide. And we are ready to come to
